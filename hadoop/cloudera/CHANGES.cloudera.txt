    MAPREDUCE-2472. Extra whitespace in mapred.child.java.opts breaks JVM initialization.
    
    When creating taskjvm.sh, we split mapred.child.java.opts on " " and
    then create a quoted argument for each of those results. So, if you
    have an extra space anywhere in this configuration, you get an
    argument '' in the child command line, which the JVM interprets as an
    empty class name. This results in a ClassNotFoundException and the
    task cannot run.

    HADOOP-5464. DFSClient does not treat write timeout of 0 properly.
    
    dfs.datanode.socket.write.timeout is used for sockets to and from
    datanodes. It is 8 minutes by default. Some users set this to 0,
    effectively disabling the write timeout (for some specific reasons).
    
    When this is set to 0, DFSClient sets the timeout to 5 seconds by
    mistake while writing to DataNodes. This is exactly the opposite of
    real intention of setting it to 0 since 5 seconds is too short.

    Amend MAPREDUCE-2234. Previous patch resulted in too many ls -l calls during heartbeats
    
    The previous commit under this JIRA changed the checkLocalDirs function to use
    the checkDir() function that takes a permission. This is fine at startup, but
    is expensive since it results in an `ls -l` fork for every local directory.
    This happens on every heartbeat and is not necessary. This patch amends
    the function to only use this form of checkDir() at start time, and otherwise
    just use the less expensive native java calls.

    fts.h which is incompatible with the resultant CFLAG when building 32-bit.
    
    Reason: RHEL5 32-bit build

    MAPREDUCE-2256. FairScheduler fairshare preemption from multiple pools may
    preempt all tasks from one pool causing that pool to go below fairshare.
    
    You have a cluster with 600 map slots and 3 pools. Fairshare for each pool is
    200 to start with. Fairsharepreemption timeout is 5 mins.
    
    1) Pool1 schedules 300 map tasks first
    2) Pool2 then schedules another 300 map tasks
    3) Pool3 demands 300 map tasks but doesn't get any slot as all slots are taken.
    4) After 5 mins pool3 should preempt 200 map-slots. Instead of peempting 100
    slots each from pool1 and pool2, the bug would cause it to preempt all 200
    slots from pool2 (last started) causing it to go below fairshare. This is
    happening because the preemptTask method is not reducing the tasks left from a
    pool while preempting the tasks.
    
    The above scenario could be an extreme case but some amount of excess
    preemption would happen because of this bug.

    There may be a delta in FSDirectory#replaceNode even with identical

    block if newnode is under construction. This causes us to incorrectly
    reduce the space consumed for quota accounting. Looking at uses of

    HADOOP-6946. SecurityUtil's ticket-fetching should call UGI.getCurrentUser rather than directly accessing JAAS
    
    This fixes a bug where a daemon could call login() and thus set the loginUser(),
    and then still have a null Subject, leading to an inability to fetch TGTs.
    This impacted, for example, the "-checkpoint force" start-up option of the 2NN.

    Description: If the datanode experiences an error in sending its block

    MAPREDUCE-1302. TrackerDistributedCacheManager can delete file asynchronously
    
    Description: With the help of AsyncDiskService from MAPREDUCE-1213, we should be able to delete
    files from distributed cache asynchronously. That will help make task initialization faster, because task initialization calls the code that
    localizes files into the cache and may delete some other files.
    The deletion can slow down the task initialization speed.

    MAPREDUCE-1213. TaskTrackers restart is very slow because it deletes distributed cache directory synchronously
    
    Description: We are seeing that when we restart a tasktracker, it tries to recursively delete all
    the file in the distributed cache. It invoked FileUtil.fullyDelete() which is very very slow. This
    means that the TaskTracker cannot join the cluster for an extended period of time (upto 2 hours for
    us). The problem is acute if the number of files in a distributed cache is a few-thousands.

    HADOOP-1849. IPC server max queue size should be configurable.
    
    Description: Currently max queue size for IPC server is set to (100 *
    handlers). Usually when RPC failures are observed (e.g. HADOOP-1763),
    we increase number of handlers and the problem goes away. I think a
    big part of such a fix is increase in max queue size. I think we
    should make maxQsize per handler configurable (with a bigger default
    than 100). There are other improvements also (HADOOP-1841).  Server
    keeps reading RPC requests from clients. When the number in-flight
    RPCs is larger than maxQsize, the earliest RPCs are deleted. This is
    the main feedback Server has for the client. I have often heard from
    users that Hadoop doesn't handle bursty traffic.
    
    Say handler count is 10 (default) and Server can handle 1000 RPCs a
    sec (quite conservative/low for a typical server), it implies that an
    RPC can wait for only for 1 sec before it is dropped. If there 3000
    clients and all of them send RPCs around the same time (not very rare,
    with heartbeats etc), 2000 will be dropped. In stead of dropping the
    earliest RPCs, if the server delays reading new RPCs, the feedback to
    clients would be much smoother, I will file another jira regd queue
    management.
    
    For this jira I propose to make queue size per handler configurable,
    with a larger default (may be 500).

    HADOOP-6723. Unchecked exceptions thrown in IPC connection should not orphan clients.
    
    Description: If the server sends back some malformed data, for
    example, receiveResponse() can end up with an incorrect call ID. Then,
    when it tries to find it in the calls map, it will end up with null
    and throw NPE in receiveResponse. This isn't caught anywhere, so the
    original IPC client ends up hanging forever instead of catching an
    exception. Another example is if the writable implementation itself
    throws an unchecked exception or OOME.
    
    We should catch Throwable in Connection.run() and shut down the
    connection if we catch one.

    HDFS-1013. Miscellaneous improvements to HTML markup for web UIs
    
    Description: The Web UIs have various bits of bad markup (eg missing &lt;head&gt; sections, some pages missing CSS links, inconsistent td vs th for table headings). We should fix this up.
    <hr/>
        Improve markup and add Cloudera styling to Web UIs
    
        This adds a favicon and a number of HTML/CSS improvements to make the
        pages more space-efficient and easy on the eyes.
    
        This may be an incompatible change for users who are scraping the HTML
        output of the web UIs. Those users are encouraged to access the data
        programmatically rather than through scraping.
    
        The non-Cloudera-specific improvements will be contributed upstream
        as HDFS-1013 and MAPREDUCE-1544.

    Description: In testing the fair scheduler with preemption, I found a deadlock between updatePreemptionVariables and some code in the JobTracker. This was found while testing a backport of the fair scheduler to Hadoop 0.20, but it looks like it could also happen in trunk and 0.21. Details are in a comment below.

    HADOOP-4012. Providing splitting support for bzip2 compressed files
    
    Description: Hadoop assumes that if the input data is compressed, it can not be split (mainly due to the limitation of many codecs that they need the whole input stream to decompress successfully).  So in such a case, Hadoop prepares only one split per compressed file, where the lower split limit is at 0 while the upper limit is the end of the file.  The consequence of this decision is that, one compress file goes to a single mapper. Although it circumvents the limitation of codecs (as mentioned above) but reduces the parallelism substantially, as it was possible otherwise in case of splitting.
    
    <p>BZip2 is a compression / De-Compression algorithm which does compression on blocks of data and later these compressed blocks can be decompressed independent of each other.  This is indeed an opportunity that instead of one BZip2 compressed file going to one mapper, we can process chunks of file in parallel.  The correctness criteria of such a processing is that for a bzip2 compressed file, each compressed block should be processed by only one mapper and ultimately all the blocks of the file should be processed.  (By processing we mean the actual utilization of that un-compressed data (coming out of the codecs) in a mapper).</p>
    
    <p>We are writing the code to implement this suggested functionality.  Although we have used bzip2 as an example, but we have tried to extend Hadoop's compression interfaces so that any other codecs with the same capability as that of bzip2, could easily use the splitting support.  The details of these changes will be posted when we submit the code.</p>

    MAPREDUCE-707. Provide a jobconf property for explicitly assigning a job to a pool
    
    Description: A common use case of the fair scheduler is to have one pool per user, but then to define some special pools for various production jobs, import jobs, etc. Therefore, it would be nice if jobs went by default to the pool of the user who submitted them, but there was a setting to explicitly place a job in another pool. Today, this can be achieved through a sort of trick in the JobConf:
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java">&lt;property&gt;

    &lt;/property&gt;</pre>
    </div></div>

    MAPREDUCE-967. (version 2) TaskTracker does not need to fully unjar job jars
    
    Description:
        This is a performance improvement for jobs that contain a large number of
        classes. The unpacking of these jars consumes a large amount of time, as
        does the resulting cleanup. This patch changes the classpath to simply
        include the jar itself, and only unpacks the lib/ directory out of the
        jar in order to add those dependencies to the classpath.
    
        Users who previously depended on this functionality for shipping non-code
        dependencies can use the undocumented configuration parameter
        "mapreduce.job.jar.unpack.pattern" to cause specific jar contents to be unpacked
    
        This new patch version fixes a streaming regression where the "-file" argument
        no longer worked. It includes a new unit test, TestFileArgs, to protect
        against this regression.

    &lt;value&gt;/mnt/hstore2/hdfs, /home/foo/dfs&lt;/value&gt; <br/>
    &lt;/property&gt;
    
    <p>The problem is that the space after the comma causes the second directory for storage to be " /home/foo/dfs" which is in a directory named &lt;SPACE&gt; which contains a sub-dir named "home" in the hadoop datanodes default directory. This will typically cause the user's home partition to fill, but will be very hard for the user to understand since a directory with a whitespace name is hard to understand.</p>
    
    <p>(ripped from <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2366" title="Space in the value for dfs.data.dir can cause great problems"><del>HADOOP-2366</del></a>)</p>

    This fixes any configuration consisting of a comma-separated list of directories
    (e.g., dfs.data.dir, dfs.name.dir, fs.checkpoint.dir, mapred.local.dir, etc) so that
    the elements may also contain separating whitespace. Without this patch,
    setting mapred.local.dir to "/disk1, /disk2" would create a directory by the name
    " " in the user's home directory, or fail outright. The patch trims the

    do not exist are ignored.  <br/>
      &lt;/description&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/property&gt;</p>
    
    <p>The problem is that the space after the comma causes the second directory for storage to be " /home/foo/dfs" which is in a directory named &lt;SPACE&gt; which contains a sub-dir named "home" in the hadoop datanodes default directory.  This will typically cause the user's home partition to fill, but will be very hard for the user to understand since a directory with a whitespace name is hard to understand.</p>
    
    <p>My proposed solution would be to trimLeft all path names from this and similar property after splitting on comma.  This still allows spaces in file and directory names but avoids this problem. </p>
    <hr/>
        This provides support in Configuration to get comma-separated string lists in such
        a way that whitespace in between elements is ignored. This patch is required for
        later patches which fix mapred.local.dir, dfs.data.dir, etc to support spaces
        in between elements.

    HDFS-412. Hadoop JMX usage makes Nagios monitoring impossible
    
    Description: When Hadoop reports Datanode information to JMX, the bean uses the name "DataNode-" + storageid.  The storage ID incorporates a random number and is unpredictable.
    
    <p>This prevents me from monitoring DFS datanodes through Hadoop using the JMX interface; in order to do that, you must be able to specify the bean name on the command line.</p>
    
    <p>The fix is simple, patch will be coming momentarily.  However, there was probably a reason for making the datanodes all unique names which I'm unaware of, so it'd be nice to hear from the metrics maintainer.</p>

    Description: On branch-20 currently, I get an error just running "ant contrib -Dtestcase=TestHdfsProxy". In a full "ant test" build sometimes this doesn't appear to be an issue. The problem is that the contrib projects don't automatically pull in the dependencies of the "Hadoop" ivy project. Thus, they each have to declare all of the common dependencies like commons-cli, etc. Some are missing and this causes test failures.

The issue is that DFSInputStream relies on readChunk being called one last time at the end of the file in order to receive the lastPacketInBlock=true packet from the DN. However, DFSInputStream.read checks pos &lt; getFileLength() before issuing the read. Thus gotEOS never shifts to true and checksumOk() is never called.

    Description: created from hdfs-200.
    
    <p>If during a write, the dfsclient sees that a block replica location for a newly allocated block is not-connectable, it re-requests the NN to get a fresh set of replica locations of the block. It tries this dfs.client.block.write.retries times (default 3), sleeping 6 seconds between each retry ( see DFSClient.nextBlockOutputStream).</p>
    
    <p>This setting works well when you have a reasonable size cluster; if u have few datanodes in the cluster, every retry maybe pick the dead-datanode and the above logic bails out.</p>
    
    <p>Our solution: when getting block location from namenode, we give nn the excluded datanodes. The list of dead datanodes is only for one block allocation.</p>

    MAPREDUCE-706. Support for FIFO pools in the fair scheduler
    
    Description: The fair scheduler should support making the internal scheduling algorithm for some pools be FIFO instead of fair sharing in order to work better for batch workloads. FIFO pools will behave exactly like the current default scheduler, sorting jobs by priority and then submission time. Pools will have their scheduling algorithm set through the pools config file, and it will be changeable at runtime.
    
    <p>To support this feature, I'm also changing the internal logic of the fair scheduler to no longer use deficits. Instead, for fair sharing, we will assign tasks to the job farthest below its share as a ratio of its share. This is easier to combine with other scheduling algorithms and leads to a more stable sharing situation, avoiding unfairness issues brought up in <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-543" title="large pending jobs hog resources"><del>MAPREDUCE-543</del></a> and <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-544" title="deficit computation is biased by historical load">MAPREDUCE-544</a> that happen when some jobs have long tasks. The new preemption (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-551" title="Add preemption to the fair scheduler"><del>MAPREDUCE-551</del></a>) will ensure that critical jobs can gain their fair share within a bounded amount of time.</p>

    HADOOP-5640. Allow ServicePlugins to hook callbacks into key service events
    
    Description: <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5257" title="Export namenode/datanode functionality through a pluggable RPC layer"><del>HADOOP-5257</del></a> added the ability for NameNode and DataNode to start and stop ServicePlugin implementations at NN/DN start/stop. However, this is insufficient integration for some common use cases.
    
    <p>We should add some functionality for Plugins to subscribe to events generated by the service they're plugging into. Some potential hook points are:</p>
    
    <p>NameNode:</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>new datanode registered</li>
    	<li>datanode has died</li>
    	<li>exception caught</li>
    	<li>etc?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>DataNode:</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>startup</li>
    	<li>initial registration with NN complete (this is important for HADOOP-4707 to sync up datanode.dnRegistration.name with the NN-side registration)</li>
    	<li>namenode reconnect</li>
    	<li>some block transfer hooks?</li>
    	<li>exception caught</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I see two potential routes for implementation:</p>
    
    <p>1) We make an enum for the types of hookpoints and have a general function in the ServicePlugin interface. Something like:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java"><span class="code-keyword">enum</span> HookPoint {
      DN_STARTUP,
      DN_RECEIVED_NEW_BLOCK,
      DN_CAUGHT_EXCEPTION,
     ...
    }
    
    void runHook(HookPoint hp, <span class="code-object">Object</span> value);</pre>
    </div></div>
    
    <p>2) We make classes specific to each "pluggable" as was originally suggested in HADDOP-5257. Something like:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java">class DataNodePlugin {
      void datanodeStarted() {}
      void receivedNewBlock(block info, etc) {}
      void caughtException(Exception e) {}
      ...
    }</pre>
    </div></div>
    
    <p>I personally prefer option (2) since we can ensure plugin API compatibility at compile-time, and we avoid an ugly switch statement in a runHook() function.</p>

    MAPREDUCE-1017. Compression and output splitting for Sqoop
    
    Description: Sqoop "direct mode" writing will generate a single large text file in HDFS. It is important to be able to compress this data before it reaches HDFS. Due to the difficulty in splitting compressed files in HDFS for use by MapReduce jobs, data should also be split at compression time.

    MAPREDUCE-551. Add preemption to the fair scheduler
    
    Description: Task preemption is necessary in a multi-user Hadoop cluster for two reasons: users might submit long-running tasks by mistake (e.g. an infinite loop in a map program), or tasks may be long due to having to process large amounts of data. The Fair Scheduler (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3746" title="A fair sharing job scheduler"><del>HADOOP-3746</del></a>) has a concept of guaranteed capacity for certain queues, as well as a goal of providing good performance for interactive jobs on average through fair sharing. Therefore, it will support preempting under two conditions:<br/>
    1) A job isn't getting its <em>guaranteed</em> share of the cluster for at least T1 seconds.<br/>
    2) A job is getting significantly less than its <em>fair</em> share for T2 seconds (e.g. less than half its share).
    
    <p>T1 will be chosen smaller than T2 (and will be configurable per queue) to meet guarantees quickly. T2 is meant as a last resort in case non-critical jobs in queues with no guaranteed capacity are being starved.</p>
    
    <p>When deciding which tasks to kill to make room for the job, we will use the following heuristics:</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>Look for tasks to kill only in jobs that have more than their fair share, ordering these by deficit (most overscheduled jobs first).</li>
    	<li>For maps: kill tasks that have run for the least amount of time (limiting wasted time).</li>
    	<li>For reduces: similar to maps, but give extra preference for reduces in the copy phase where there is not much map output per task (at Facebook, we have observed this to be the main time we need preemption - when a job has a long map phase and its reducers are mostly sitting idle and filling up slots).</li>
    </ul>
    
    This fixes an error in the previous backport where the
    EagerTaskInitializationListener wasn't properly passed the
    TaskTrackerManager before starting.

    ...</p>
    
    <p>The investigation showed that the root of this issue is that we exceeded # of xcievers in the data nodes and that was fixed by changing configuration settings to 2k.<br/>
    However - one thing that bothered me was that even after datanodes recovered from overload and most of client servers had been shut down - we still observed errors in the logs of running servers.<br/>
    Further investigation showed that fix for <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-1911" title="infinite loop in dfs -cat command."><del>HADOOP-1911</del></a> introduced another problem - the DFSInputStream instance might become unusable once number of failures over lifetime of this instance exceeds configured threshold.</p>
    
    <p>The fix for this specific issue seems to be trivial - just reset failure counter before reading next block (patch will be attached shortly).</p>
    
    <p>This seems to be also related to HADOOP-3185, but I'm not sure I really understand necessity of keeping track of failed block accesses in the DFS client.</p>

    MAPREDUCE-987. Exposing MiniDFS and MiniMR clusters as a single process command-line
    
    Description: It's hard to test non-Java programs that rely on significant mapreduce functionality.  The patch I'm proposing shortly will let you just type "bin/hadoop jar hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test.jar minicluster" to start a cluster (internally, it's using Mini{MR,HDFS}Cluster) with a specified number of daemons, etc.  A test that checks how some external process interacts with Hadoop might start minicluster as a subprocess, run through its thing, and then simply kill the java subprocess.
    
    <p>I've been using just such a system for a couple of weeks, and I like it.  It's significantly easier than developing a lot of scripts to start a pseudo-distributed cluster, and then clean up after it.  I figure others might find it useful as well.</p>
    
    <p>I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to put it in 0.21.  hdfs-with-mr tests have all the required libraries, so I've put it there.  I could conceivably split this into "minimr" and "minihdfs", but it's specifically the fact that they're configured to talk to each other that I like about having them together.  And one JVM is better than two for my test programs.</p>

    HADOOP-5640. Allow ServicePlugins to hook callbacks into key service events
    
    Description: <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5257" title="Export namenode/datanode functionality through a pluggable RPC layer"><del>HADOOP-5257</del></a> added the ability for NameNode and DataNode to start and stop ServicePlugin implementations at NN/DN start/stop. However, this is insufficient integration for some common use cases.
    
    <p>We should add some functionality for Plugins to subscribe to events generated by the service they're plugging into. Some potential hook points are:</p>
    
    <p>NameNode:</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>new datanode registered</li>
    	<li>datanode has died</li>
    	<li>exception caught</li>
    	<li>etc?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>DataNode:</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>startup</li>
    	<li>initial registration with NN complete (this is important for HADOOP-4707 to sync up datanode.dnRegistration.name with the NN-side registration)</li>
    	<li>namenode reconnect</li>
    	<li>some block transfer hooks?</li>
    	<li>exception caught</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I see two potential routes for implementation:</p>
    
    <p>1) We make an enum for the types of hookpoints and have a general function in the ServicePlugin interface. Something like:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java"><span class="code-keyword">enum</span> HookPoint {
      DN_STARTUP,
      DN_RECEIVED_NEW_BLOCK,
      DN_CAUGHT_EXCEPTION,
     ...
    }
    
    void runHook(HookPoint hp, <span class="code-object">Object</span> value);</pre>
    </div></div>
    
    <p>2) We make classes specific to each "pluggable" as was originally suggested in HADDOP-5257. Something like:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java">class DataNodePlugin {
      void datanodeStarted() {}
      void receivedNewBlock(block info, etc) {}
      void caughtException(Exception e) {}
      ...
    }</pre>
    </div></div>
    
    <p>I personally prefer option (2) since we can ensure plugin API compatibility at compile-time, and we avoid an ugly switch statement in a runHook() function.</p>
    
    <p>Interested to hear what people's thoughts are here.</p>

    HADOOP-5257. Export namenode/datanode functionality through a pluggable RPC layer
    
    Description: Adding support for pluggable components would allow exporting DFS functionallity using arbitrary protocols, like Thirft or Protocol Buffers. I'm opening this issue on Dhruba's suggestion in HADOOP-4707.
    
    <p>Plug-in implementations would extend this base class:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java"><span class="code-keyword">abstract</span> class Plugin {
    
        <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-keyword">abstract</span> datanodeStarted(DataNode datanode);
    
        <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-keyword">abstract</span> datanodeStopping();
    
        <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-keyword">abstract</span> namenodeStarted(NameNode namenode);
    
        <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-keyword">abstract</span> namenodeStopping();
    }</pre>
    </div></div>
    
    <p>Name node instances would then start the plug-ins according to a configuration object, and would also shut them down when the node goes down:</p>
    
    <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
    <pre class="code-java"><span class="code-keyword">public</span> class NameNode {
    
        <span class="code-comment">// [..]

        }

    </span>
        <span class="code-keyword">public</span> void stop() {

Ironically, Cloudera's hadoop distro is the one that puts + characters in jar files, and so exhibits the bug.  Here is an example from running sqoop with log4j at debug level.  Note the space in the very last term, which should read hadoop-0.20.0+61-sqoop.jar rather than hadoop-0.20.0 61-sqoop.jar.

    HADOOP-5450. Add support for application-specific typecodes to typed bytes
    
    Description: For serializing objects of types that are not supported by typed bytes serialization, applications might want to use a custom serialization format. Right now, typecode 0 has to be used for the bytes resulting from this custom serialization, which could lead to problems when deserializing the objects because the application cannot know if a byte sequence following typecode 0 is a customly serialized object or just a raw sequence of bytes. Therefore, a range of typecodes that are treated as aliases for 0 should be added, such that different typecodes can be used for application-specific purposes.

    HADOOP-1722. Make streaming to handle non-utf8 byte array
    
    Description: Right now, the streaming framework expects the output sof the steam process (mapper or reducer) are line <br/>
    oriented UTF-8 text. This limit makes it impossible to use those programs whose outputs may be non-UTF-8<br/>
     (international encoding, or maybe even binary data). Streaming can overcome this limit by introducing a simple<br/>
    encoding protocol. For example, it can allow the mapper/reducer to hexencode its keys/values, <br/>
    the framework decodes them in the Java side.<br/>
    This way, as long as the mapper/reducer executables follow this encoding protocol, <br/>
    they can output arabitary bytearray and the streaming framework can handle them.

    MAPREDUCE-885. More efficient SQL queries for DBInputFormat
    
    Description: DBInputFormat generates InputSplits by counting the available rows in a table, and selecting subsections of the table via the "LIMIT" and "OFFSET" SQL keywords. These are only meaningful in an ordered context, so the query also includes an "ORDER BY" clause on an index column. The resulting queries are often inefficient and require full table scans. Actually using multiple mappers with these queries can lead to O(n^2) behavior in the database, where n is the number of splits. Attempting to use parallelism with these queries is counter-productive.
    
    <p>A better mechanism is to organize splits based on data values themselves, which can be performed in the WHERE clause, allowing for index range scans of tables, and can better exploit parallelism in the database.</p>

    Description: The JobClient.NetworkedJob.waitForCompletion() method polls for job completion every 5 seconds. When running a set of short tests in pseudo-distributed mode, this is unnecessarily slow and causes lots of wasted time. When bandwidth is not scarce, setting the poll interval to 100 ms results in a 4x speedup in some tests.  This interval should be parametrized to allow users to control the interval for testing purposes.

This allows per-database logic to be encapsulated in different ConnManager instances, and dynamically chosen based on which database the user is actually importing from. But adding new ConnManager implementations requires modifying the source of a common ConnFactory class.

    Description: There are a number of use cases for being able to do this.  The focus of this jira should be on finding what would be the simplest to implement that would satisfy the most use cases.
    
    <p>This could be implemented as either a per-node maximum or a cluster-wide maximum.  It seems that for most uses, the former is preferable however either would fulfill the requirements of this jira.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the reasons for allowing this feature (mine and from others on list):</p>
    <ul class="alternate" type="square">
    	<li>I have some very large CPU-bound jobs.  I am forced to keep the max map/node limit at 2 or 3 (on a 4 core node) so that I do not starve the Datanode and Regionserver.  I have other jobs that are network latency bound and would like to be able to run high numbers of them concurrently on each node.  Though I can thread some jobs, there are some use cases that are difficult to thread (scanning from hbase) and there's significant complexity added to the job rather than letting hadoop handle the concurrency.</li>
    	<li>Poor assignment of tasks to nodes creates some situations where you have multiple reducers on a single node but other nodes that received none.  A limit of 1 reducer per node for that job would prevent that from happening. (only works with per-node limit)</li>
    	<li>Poor mans MR job virtualization.  Since we can limit a jobs resources, this gives much more control in allocating and dividing up resources of a large cluster.  (makes most sense w/ cluster-wide limit)</li>

If you use the JDBC mechanism, it prints a warning if you could have enabled the mysqldump path instead. But the warning is printed multiple times (every time the LocalMySQLManager is instantiated), and also when the MySQL manager is used for informational queries (e.g., listing tables) rather than true imports.

    HADOOP-5967. Sqoop should only use a single map task
    
    Description: The current DBInputFormat implementation uses SELECT ... LIMIT ... OFFSET statements to
    read from a database table. This actually results in several queries all accessing the same table at
    the same time. Most database implementations will actually use a full table scan for each such
    query, starting at row 1 and scanning down until the OFFSET is reached before emitting data to the
    client. The upshot of this is that we see O(n^2) performance in the size of the table when using a
    large number of mappers, when a single mapper would read through the table in O(n) time in the number of rows.
    
    <p>This patch sets the number of map tasks to 1 in the MapReduce job sqoop launches.</p>

    HADOOP-5887. Sqoop should create tables in Hive metastore after importing to HDFS
    
    Description: Sqoop (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5815" title="Sqoop: A database import tool for Hadoop"><del>HADOOP-5815</del></a>) imports tables into HDFS; it is a straightforward enhancement to then generate a Hive DDL statement to recreate the table definition in the Hive metastore and move the imported table into the Hive warehouse directory from its upload target.
    
    <p>This feature enhancement makes this process automatic. An import is performed with sqoop in the usual way; providing the argument "--hive-import" will cause it to then issue a CREATE TABLE .. LOAD DATA INTO statement to a Hive shell. It generates a script file and then attempts to run "$HIVE_HOME/bin/hive" on it, or failing that, any "hive" on the $PATH; $HIVE_HOME can be overridden with --hive-home. As a result, no direct linking against Hive is necessary.</p>
    
    <p>The unit tests provided with this enhancement use a mock implementation of 'bin/hive' that compares the script it's fed with one from a directory full of "expected" scripts. The exact script file referenced is controlled via an environment variable. It doesn't actually load into a proper Hive metastore, but manual testing has shown that this process works in practice, so the mock implementation is a reasonable unit testing tool.</p>

    HADOOP-5518. MRUnit unit test library
    
    Description: MRUnit is a tool to help authors of MapReduce programs write unit tests.
    
    Testing map() and reduce() methods requires some repeated work to mock the inputs and outputs of a Mapper or Reducer class, and ensure that the correct values are emitted to the OutputCollector based on inputs. Also, testing a mapper and reducer together requires running them with the sorted ordering guarantees made by the shuffle process.
    
    This library provides the above functionality to authors of maps and reduces; it allows you to test maps, reduces, and map-reduce pairs without needing to perform all the setup and teardown work associated with running a job.

    HADOOP-5844. Use mysqldump when connecting to local mysql instance in Sqoop
    
    Description: Sqoop uses MapReduce + DBInputFormat to read the contents of a table into HDFS. On many databases, this implementation is O(N^2) in the number of rows. Also, the use of multiple mappers has low value in terms of throughput, because the database itself is inherently singlethreaded. While DBInputFormat/JDBC provides a useful fallback mechanism for importing from databases, db-specific dump utilities will nearly always provide faster throughput, and should be selected when available. This patch allows users to use mysqldump to read from local mysql instances instead of the MapReduce-based input.
    Reason: Performance improvement

    HADOOP-5815. Sqoop: A database import tool for Hadoop
    
    Description:
    Sqoop is a tool designed to help users import existing relational databases into their Hadoop clusters. Sqoop uses JDBC to connect to a database, examine the schema for tables, and auto-generate the necessary classes to import data into HDFS. It then instantiates a MapReduce job to read the table from the database via the DBInputFormat (JDBC-based InputFormat). The table is read into a set of files loaded into HDFS. Both SequenceFile and text-based targets are supported.

    MAPREDUCE-714. JobConf.findContainingJar unescapes unnecessarily on Linux
    
    Description: In JobConf.findContainingJar, the path name is decoded using URLDecoder.decode(...). This was done by Doug in r381794 (commit msg "Un-escape containing jar's path, which is URL-encoded.  This fixes things primarily on Windows, where paths are likely to contain spaces.") Unfortunately, jar paths do not appear to be URL encoded on Linux. If you try to use "hadoop jar" on a jar with a "+" in it, this function decodes it to a space and then the job cannot be submitted.
    Reason: Cloudera-based packages include a '+' in the filename; Hadoop's URL escaper will not
    properly handle jar filenames with a '+' without this patch.

    Description:
        This should make the "hadoop version" output far more useful for
        determing exactly what code is running. The cloudera.hash property is
        set by cloudera/build.properties which is generated during the build
        process.

    CLOUDERA-BUILD. Move saveVersion.sh in build.xml to ensure build
    
    Description:
        This error is due to ant 1.7.1 not compiling package-info.java if the
        timestamp of the output class directory is newer than the package-info
        file itself. Since other compiles were happening after package-info.java
        was generated, the build dir was newer and compilation was being
        skipped.
    
        Move cloudera hooks inside the package task of build.xml
    
        Fixes an issue where the fair scheduler jar was not built before the
        hooks were run, and therefore was not included in the target lib/
        directory.
