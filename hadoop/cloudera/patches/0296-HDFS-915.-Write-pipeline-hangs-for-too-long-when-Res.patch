Subject: [PATCH 0296/1020] HDFS-915. Write pipeline hangs for too long when ResponseProcessor hits timeout

Description: Previously, the write pipeline would hang for the entire write
             timeout when it encountered a read timeout (eg due to a
             network connectivity issue). This patch interrupts the writing
             thread when a read error occurs.
Reason: Faster recovery from pipeline failure for HBase and other
        interactive applications.
