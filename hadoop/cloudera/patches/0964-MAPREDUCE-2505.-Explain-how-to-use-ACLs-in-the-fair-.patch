Subject: [PATCH 0964/1020] MAPREDUCE-2505. Explain how to use ACLs in the fair scheduler.

The fair scheduler already works with the ACL system introduced through the
mapred.queue.* parameters, but the documentation doesn't explain how to use
this. We should add a paragraph or two about it.

Reason: Improvement

+          The fair scheduler can be used in tandem with the "queue" based access
+          control system in MapReduce to restrict which pools each user can access.
+          To do this, first enable ACLs and set up some queues as described in the
+          <a href="mapred_tutorial.html#Job+Authorization">MapReduce usage guide</a>,
+          then set the fair scheduler to use one pool per queue by adding
+          the following property in <em>HADOOP_CONF_DIR/mapred-site.xml</em>:
+        </p>
+<source>
+&lt;property&gt;
+  &lt;name&gt;mapred.fairscheduler.poolnameproperty&lt;/name&gt;
+  &lt;value&gt;mapred.job.queue.name&lt;/value&gt;
+&lt;/property&gt;
+</source>
+        <p>
+          You can then set the minimum share, weight, and internal scheduling mode
+          for each pool as described earlier.
+          In addition, make sure that users submit jobs to the right queue by setting
+          the <em>mapred.job.queue.name</em> property in their jobs.
