### Welcome
HadoopSingleNode is an app that provides a click and play solution for Hadoop on Mac OS X. You can just hit play and debug your MapReduce programs in a blink of an eye.

### Installing
The repo doesn't contain a dmg image for the app so you need to download the github repository and open the xcode project. After building it in xcode you can use your app!

### Future releases
This app is really simple and only supports single node setup for Hadoop. For future releases it might be awesome to include several config files for Hadoop so you can run the files on the cluster instead of one single node. 

### Authors and Contributors
