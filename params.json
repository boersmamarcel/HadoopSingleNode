You can just hit play and debug your MapReduce programs in a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots:\r\n![Play](http://i50.tinypic.com/rw4fhy.png)\r\n![Your own jobs](http://i46.tinypic.com/35ycm.png)\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\nThe repo doesn't contain a dmg image for the app so you need to download the github repository and open the xcode project. After building it in xcode you can use your app!\r\n\r\n### Future releases\r\nThis app is really simple and only supports single node setup for Hadoop. For future releases it might be awesome to include several config files for Hadoop so you can run the files on the cluster instead of one single node. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis app is developed by Marcel Boersma (@boersmamarcel). All icons from the app are from http://www.glyphish.com/ and the Hadoop server is from Cloudera check http://www.cloudera.com.\r\nAnd all other trademarks are property of their respective owners.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with HadoopSingleNode?
